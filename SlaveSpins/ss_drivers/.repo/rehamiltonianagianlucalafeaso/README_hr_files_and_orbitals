DFT calculation + Wannier from G Giovannetti.

Output:

FeSe_hr.dat -> Raw output from Wannier90: 2 Fe sites

hr.dat.out -> 1Fe file from GG

Conventions here are:  z^2-r^2,  xz,  yz,  x^2-y^2,  xy


hr_oo.dat -> file with change of orbitals for Lanat√†'s conventions (x^2-y^2, xz, z^2-r^2, yz, xy)

All calculations done before 28 October 2013 are done with Lanata's file because I didn't have the original GG one.
